    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 1, 2025</p>

    <p><strong>Take Flight Global Education Consulting LLC</strong> (‚ÄúTake Flight‚Äù) is not a source or supplier of
      educational or travel services. It acts solely as an agent for the universities and other institutions
      (‚ÄúProviders‚Äù) it represents.</p>

    <p>The Providers whose names appear in materials supplied by Take Flight are solely responsible for delivering the
      educational or travel services purchased. Partners acknowledge and agree that Take Flight shall not be held
      responsible if any Provider:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
      <li>fails to deliver the services purchased;</li>
      <li>fails to comply with any applicable law; or</li>
      <li>commits any negligent act or omission that results in injury, damage, delay, or inconvenience.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Take Flight is not responsible for, and shall not be held liable for, any injury, damage, or loss arising from
      conditions, actions, or omissions beyond its reasonable control.</p>

    <p>Travel to and from many parts of the world may involve risks to health and safety, including but not limited to
      disease, crime, terrorism, and armed conflict. Take Flight does not advise or recommend travel to or from any
      particular destination at any particular time. Participants should consult the arrival and orientation
      information provided by their admitting institutions.</p>

    <p>Program participants are responsible for obtaining all required travel and immigration documents for the programs
      they attend. Many universities require accompanying documents‚Äîsuch as copies of passport identification pages and
      bank statements‚Äîwhen applying. Most U.S. institutions require an <strong>F-1 student visa</strong>, issued on the
      basis of a Form I-20 (‚ÄúCertificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status‚Äù) provided by the admitting
      university. Participants should carefully review all admission and visa documents for accuracy, as they will be
      examined by U.S. immigration officers upon entry. Student visas are obtained through U.S. embassies or consulates
      abroad. Detailed instructions are available on the
      <a href="https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Department of Homeland Security‚Äôs
      Study in the States</a> website.</p>

    <p>Admission to any university or program is granted solely at the discretion of the Provider. Take Flight is not
      responsible for any application fees, deposits, visa processing fees, SEVIS fees, or other costs associated with
      the application process. Providers may require submission of health records or proof of immunizations as part of
      their admission requirements. Take Flight assumes no responsibility for the loss of any non-refundable fees or
      deposits in the event a participant is denied admission.</p>

    <p>The visa information provided on this website is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute
      legal advice. Regulations may change without notice, and individual circumstances vary. Each participant is
      responsible for understanding and complying with all applicable U.S. immigration laws and maintaining their visa
      status. For official guidance, participants should consult a Designated School Official (DSO), review resources
      published by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, or seek advice from a qualified immigration attorney.</p>

    <p>Any costs, losses, or consequences incurred as a result of failing to obtain proper travel documents, failing
      inspection at a Port of Entry, or failing to attend the program to which admission was granted are the sole
      responsibility of the participant.</p>

    <p>All prices and other program details are subject to change without notice. Travel costs, housing, university fees,
      insurance, books, and other personal expenses are not included in the listed program prices.</p>
